Implemented using the rules described here:
http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/go-fish/

Overview

1: Create Deck
	Trusted Initializer
		- Shuffles Deck (array of integers 1-52)
		- Generates n-out-of-n share of every card for all n players
		- Each player receives array of their shares of the deck

2: Draw Hands
	Round Robin of Players
		For 0 to # starting cards
			- player sends index of card drawn to all other players
				- players mark this index as no longer in deck
				- other players return their share of this deck index

	Now each player knows their own hand and the indices of cards that can no longer be drawn

3: Play
	Round Robin of Players
		Player (Sender S) sends request(R,X,i) to Receiver R
			- R is the player number S wants to receive cards from
			- X is the card rank S is looking for (1-13)
			- i is the index of a card of rank X from S's hand
				- In order for S to request cards of rank X, they must have at least one of these cards in their hand
				- all players exchange shares of this deck index to verify that S actually has this card

		If R has card(s) of rank X
			- R sends indices of these cards to S
			- S asks all players for shares of these indices to verify them
			- S can now make another request to any player

		Else
			- R tells S to go fish
			- S sends index of card drawn to all players
			- all players send share of this index to S

		Every time S receives card(s) (from a player or from deck)
			- If S has four of a rank (aka a book)
				- S sends indices of these four cards to all players
				- All players exchange shares of these cards to verify them
